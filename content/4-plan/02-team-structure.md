## Why
A proper team structure is required to efficiently deliver values to customers. A team can perform at its best when there is clear communication and when everyone is clear on their role in the team. Good team structures consider the competencies and focus of individuals and uses these to achieve both individual objectives of team members and the larger team goals.

- Document and clearly communicate what is expected from each team individual. Itâ€™s also recommended to discuss performance measures as early as possible.
- Use project management tools to better manage the project team.
